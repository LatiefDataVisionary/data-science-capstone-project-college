I really like it. But the thing is when one hasn't subscribed to the premium features, he's deprived of many choices. That's understandable, but then part of the restrictions is that there's a limit to how many times you can choose a song from your library in a day. Another thing, the app tends to play or switch to songs that are not in my catalog while I'm playing a song stored there. it's infuriating.",5,8140,9.0.64.608,2025-08-03 05:23:17,,,9.0.64.608

It's a little redundant since you can access that from the library section. It also isn't as necessary as the other buttons. How often will someone make a new playlist?

I would pay for a subscription if I could afford it. :-( over all it's a good app with an intuitive interface and good integration with Google and Facebook services. The only bummer I can think of is that some songs cannot be found due to copyright restrictions. You are limited to the deals Spotify can strike with the music industry which seem to be bountiful save for a handful of unplayable songs.

Music quality is great also. Love the many choices of music, and options. I think it's one of the best out there if not THE best for song choices and freedom of music. They have songs from all Genres that other apps simply don't have. Commercial free, and choice to play any song you want, or create your own playlists and change them any time, or choose from other lists or stations with similar taste, is all a great option for a small monthly fee. Of course you can listen for free if you are okay with ad's and don't mind the shuffle play mandate instead of picking any song you want to play immediately. The paid plans are cheaper than satellite radio and by far better with blue-tooth radio or speakers. Even a family plan allows multiple devices to have the paid plan and listen to their own different music each at the same time if they want, for one decent price a month. They also now have an option to block explicit music for those of us who don't want to hear explicit music, or have families & children. Only thing I hope they add would be the options to once again organize music in playlists by artist or genre and also an option to mix it all up. Sometimes the shuffle button doesn't work so well. It needs programmed so the shuffle button won't play the same song twice unless it finishes all songs in the playlist first, then it can repeat songs in shuffle mode. I've had it play the same song 2 or 3 different times in my playlist without playing other songs at all :(. Please fix this!
